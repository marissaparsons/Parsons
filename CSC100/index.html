      <p class="centered_text"> The red panda is the sole living species of the Ailuridae animal family as all the other members have gone extinct. The nearest relative to the red panda was alive around three to four million years ago. The red panda has gone through multiple classifications before scientists finally determined the species family as independent.  It was originally thought that the red panda belonged to the raccoon family as the two share resemblance. The red panda was later classified as a bear, but it was found that the red panda’s evolution diverged from a common ancestor with bears over 40 million years ago. As it turns out, the original classification of the raccoon family was closer than expected as both animals share a common ancestor.</p>

      <p class="centered_text"> In Nepal, the red panda is nicknamed the Firefox. Mozilla Firefox, although their mascot is a fox, was named after the red panda. Mozilla's browser was originally named Firebird but due to copyright issues Mozilla was forced to change their name. Mozilla Firefox has paid tribute to its namesake by raising awareness on the red panda’s endangerment status. They created a 24-hour live stream which filmed two red panda cubs, Ember and Spark, at the Knoxville Zoo in Tennesse. Below is a video of Ember the Red Panda.  </p>

      <h2 class="centered_title">Real Pandas?</h2>
      <div class="roundimg"><img src="giantpanda.png" alt="" /></a></div>
      <p class="centered_text"> Technically, red pandas are the only real pandas. The giant pandas were discovered years after the red panda and were only given the ‘panda’ title because they resembled the red panda. Similarities between the two animals can be found in their eating habits (which heavily consist of bamboo) and ‘false thumb.’ Both pandas have an enlarged wrist bone which allows the animals to hold the bamboo stems as they eat. Red panda habitat and giant panda habitat overlaps in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sJxQ5AGuESPw4zFo8">Sichuan, China</a>. Unfortunately, the pandas also share hardships. They are both species are at risk of extinction and poached for their hides. The conservation movement for giant pandas has proven effective as strict laws have declined the poaching of giant panda hides and the species has gained a vulnerable status. Red pandas are an endangered species that is still being poached for the black market.  </p>
