      <h2>Behaviour</h2>
        <p> Red pandas are typically quiet, but they tweet, twitter and bark to communicate. Red pandas are active both in the daytime and at night. Red pandas, when cared by humans, will sleep up to 45% of the day as they are not having to hide from predators. In the wild, red pandas will climb trees and rocks in order to evade predators. Red pandas will also rear up on their hind legs and claw into the air if they are unable to escape.  Their predators include the snow leopard, cloud leopard (another endangered species), jackals, and humans. Red pandas are heat sensitive and tend to be more active in cooler temperatures but in significantly cold weather the pandas will become dormant. Their optimal temperature is between 17 and 25 °C. Red pandas spend very little energy throughout the day and have a similar energy exertion to sloths. After waking from sleep, red pandas will clean themselves like a house cat and rub their bodies against trees or rocks.  Human care can actually be quite beneficial to red pandas as it doubles their life span to around 23 years.  </p>
      <h3>Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Red pandas are typically solitary creatures, keeping a range of 1 square meter away from another, that will only find mates during reproductive seasons. Although, in human care breeding mates will live together year-round. Reproductive seasons differ depending on location as the climate effects when a breeding season will start. Female red pandas will stop breeding at the age of 12 but male red pandas will continue reproduction past the age of 12. Females will build nest in tree holes for their litters. Typically, a red panda will give birth to two cubs in May or June. Young red pandas are born blind and deaf with brown and white fluffy fur.  The babies will begin to open their eyes after 18 days and by 90 days the cubs will have adult fur. It takes one year for the pandas to become full grown and two to three year to fully mature.  The cubs will leave their mother after the next years litter is born repeating the reproductive cycle.  </p>

      <p> Red pandas are skillful, acrobatic climbers. Their soft woolly undercoat mixed with long, coarse guard hairs protect them from the winter creating a thermal insulation. Their tail is an important feature as it is used for warmth and balance. Their red coat is actually useful camouflage within tree canopies. Red pandas live in trees in order to hide from predators and sunbathe in the summer. Their ‘false thumb’ allows the animals to climb headfirst down trees.  </p>
